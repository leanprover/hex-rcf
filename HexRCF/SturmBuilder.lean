# Builder for multiplication-only Sturm replays

This is compiled preparation code, outside the proof trust boundary. It
instruments the existing sign-managed pseudo-remainder loop with an accumulated
integer scale and quotient, then retains a candidate only when the small
`SturmReplay.check` verifier accepts it.

The literal chain starts with the supplied polynomial itself, rather than its
primitive part. This matters for nonprimitive carrier polynomials.

semantics: `scale leftScale dividend = quotient * divisor + remainder`. -/

/-- Instrument `ZPoly.spemAux` while accumulating its exact scale and
quotient. Each reduction step multiplies the previous identity by the positive
absolute leading coefficient of `g` and adds the cancelled leading monomial to
the quotient. Unlike `ZPoly.spemAux`, the zero-fuel case accepts only a state
that has already reached a genuine stopping condition. -/
