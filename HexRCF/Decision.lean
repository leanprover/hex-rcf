# Soundness of compiled RCF decisions

The Mathlib-free certificate construction and decision pipeline live in
`HexRCF.DecisionCheck`. This module connects an accepted compiled verdict to
the real-valued reflected sentence semantics.

namespace Hex.RCF

/-- Every true compiled verdict proves the reflected sentence. -/
theorem decide_sound (s : Sentence) (h : decide s = some true) : s.toProp := by
  obtain ⟨cert, hcert⟩ := exists_cert_of_decide h
  exact check_sound s cert hcert

end Hex.RCF
