# Compiled RCF certificate assembly and decision

This Mathlib-free module runs root search, strict separation, endpoint
classification, arithmetic witness construction, and exact certificate replay.
It retains a candidate only when replay produces a well-formed verdict. The
interpretation of an accepted true verdict lives in `HexRCF.Decision`.
