# Executable sign-matrix replay

This module computes exact polynomial signs from dyadic samples and checked
common-root packages, caches one sign per distinct polynomial, and evaluates
reflected formulas on carrier cells. It contains only exact data and Boolean
or option-valued replay. The interpretation over real roots and semantic cells
lives in `HexRCF.SignMatrix`.
